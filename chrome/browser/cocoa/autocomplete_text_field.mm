//
// The reason for this code's existence is subtle.  NSTextField
// implements text selection and editing in terms of a "field editor".
// This is an NSTextView which is installed as a subview of the
// control when the field becomes first responder.  When the field
// editor is installed, it will get -mouseDown: events and handle
// them, rather than the text field - EXCEPT for the event which
// caused the change in first responder, or events which fall in the
// decorations outside the field editor's area.  In that case, the
// default NSTextField code will setup the field editor all over
// again, which has the side effect of doing "select all" on the text.
// This effect can be observed with a normal NSTextField if you click
// in the narrow border area, and is only really a problem because in
// our case the focus ring surrounds decorations which look clickable.
//
// When the user first clicks on the field, after installing the field
// editor the default NSTextField code detects if the hit is in the
// field editor area, and if so sets the selection to {0,0} to clear
// the selection before forwarding the event to the field editor for
// processing (it will set the cursor position).  This also starts the
// click-drag selection machinery.
//
// This code does the same thing for cases where the click was in the
// decoration area.  This allows the user to click-drag starting from
// a decoration area and get the expected selection behaviour,
// likewise for multiple clicks in those areas.
