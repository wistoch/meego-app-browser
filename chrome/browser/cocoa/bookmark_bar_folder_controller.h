  // Bookmark bar folder controller chains are torn down in two ways:
  // 1. Clicking "outside" the folder (see use of
  // CrApplicationEventHookProtocol in the bookmark bar controller).
  // 2. Engaging a different folder (via hover over or explicit click).
  //
  // In either case, the BookmarkButtonControllerProtocol method
  // closeAllBookmarkFolders gets called.  For bookmark bar folder
  // controllers, this is passed up the chain so we begin with a top
  // level "close".
  // When any bookmark folder window closes, it necessarily tells
  // subcontroller windows to close (down the chain), and autoreleases
  // the controller.  (Must autorelease since the controller can still
  // get delegate events such as windowDidClose).
  //
  // Bookmark bar folder controllers own their buttons.  When doing
  // drag and drop of a button from one sub-sub-folder to a different
  // sub-sub-folder, we need to make sure the button's pointers stay
  // valid until we've dropped (or cancelled).  Note that such a drag
  // causes the source sub-sub-folder (previous parent window) to go
  // away (windows close, controllers autoreleased) since you're
  // hovering over a different folder chain for dropping.  To keep
  // things valid (like the button's target, its delegate, the parent
  // cotroller that we have a pointer to below [below], etc), we heep
  // strong pointers to our owning controller, so the entire chain
  // stays owned.

  // Our parent controller.  This may be another
  // BookmarkBarFolderController (if we are a nested folder) or it may
  // be the BookmarkBarController (if not).
  // Strong to insure the object lives as long as we need it.

  // window closes the controller gets autoreleased).
