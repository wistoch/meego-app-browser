#ifndef CHROME_BROWSER_TAB_WINDOW_CONTROLLER_H_
#define CHROME_BROWSER_TAB_WINDOW_CONTROLLER_H_

// A class acting as the Objective-C window controller for a window that has
// tabs which can be dragged around. Tabs can be re-arranged within the same
// window or dragged into other TabWindowController windows. This class doesn't
// know anything about the actual tab implementation or model, as that is fairly
// application-specific. It only provides an API to be overridden by subclasses
// to fill in the details.
//
// This assumes that there will be a view in the nib, connected to
// |tabContentArea_|, that indicates the content that it switched when switching
// between tabs. It needs to be a regular NSView, not something like an NSBox
// because the TabStripController makes certain assumptions about how it can
// swap out subviews.
