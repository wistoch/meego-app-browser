// Include this file if you need to access the Debugger outside of the debugger
// project.  Don't include debugger.h directly.  If there's functionality from
// Debugger needed, add new wrapper methods to this file.
//
// This is a workaround to enable the Debugger without breaking the KJS build.
// It wraps all methods in Debugger which are called from outside of the
// debugger project.  Each solution has its own project with debugger files.
// KJS has only debugger_wrapper* and debugger.h, and defines
// CHROME_DEBUGGER_DISABLED, which makes it compile only a stub version of
// Debugger that doesn't reference V8.  Meanwhile the V8 solution includes all
// of the debugger files without CHROME_DEBUGGER_DISABLED so the full
// functionality is enabled.
