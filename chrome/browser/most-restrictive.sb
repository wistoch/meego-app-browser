; This is the Sandbox configuration file used for safeguarding the worker
; process which is used to run web workers in a sandboxed environment.  It
; is also used to run the user's untrusted code within Native Client.
;
; This is the most restrictive sandbox profile and only enables just enough
; to allow basic use of Cocoa.
(version 1)
(deny default)
; Support for programmatically enabling verbose debugging.
;ENABLE_LOGGING (debug deny)

; Allow sending signals to self - http://crbug.com/20370
(allow signal (target self))

; Needed for full-page-zoomed controls - http://crbug.com/11325
(allow sysctl-read)

; Each line is marked with the System version that needs it.
; This profile is tested with the following system versions:
;     10.5.6, 10.6

; Allow following symlinks
(allow file-read-metadata)  ; 10.5.6

; Loading System Libraries.
(allow file-read-data (regex #"^/System/Library/Frameworks($|/)"))  ; 10.5.6
(allow file-read-data (regex #"^/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks($|/)"))  ; 10.5.6
(allow file-read-data (regex #"^/System/Library/CoreServices($|/)"))  ; 10.5.6

; Needed for IPC on 10.6
;10.6_ONLY (allow ipc-posix-shm)

; Needed for the Native Client plugin and loader. These lines are enabled
; if and only if --internal-nacl (or --enable-nacl) are used (and they
; are off by default.)
; TODO(msneck): Refactor Native Client to use something other than Unix
; sockets. Then change the code in chrome/common/sandbox_mac.mm which
; deals with the ";NACL" prefix.
; See http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=344
