This sample shows how to use browser DBus API to 
manage tabs.

The main GUI window allows you to open browser in
3 modes:
* URL mode    - Open the given url in a new tab
* Search mode - Search the given target in a new tab
                with default search engine configured
                in browser
* Tab mode    - Parse the given target as tab id and 
                switch it in browser

 The text box on left side will print the DBus signal
 name emitted from browser.

 In addition, the thumbnail of a tab can also be 
 display for demo.
