    <p>This is a <i>pre-alpha</i> build of Chromium on Linux. It is woefully
    incomplete.</p>

    <div class="faq">

    <h3>It's &lsquo;Chromium&rsquo;, not &lsquo;Google Chrome&rsquo;:</h3>

    <p><a href="http://code.google.com/chromium/">Chromium</a> is an open
    source browser project. <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Google
      Chrome</a> is a browser from Google, based on the Chromium project. This
    is a build of Chromium. No versions of Google Chrome for Linux will exist
    until Google makes an official release.</p>

    <h3>Please don't file bugs:</h3>

    <p>At this point there are so many gaping holes that finding bugs is not
    the problem and dealing with them is just a distraction.</p>

    <h3>Blogging about it is not helpful:</h3>

    <p>Chromium's problem is not a lack of media attention, but an excess of
    it. Coverage encourages people to try it out in this incomplete state which
    only creates negative first impressions. Also, dealing with
    misunderstandings/questions etc only distracts the team from the job of
    improving it.</p>

    <p>Likewise, keep in mind that we won't see your comments if they're on a
    random blog somewhere.</p>

    <h3>How to help:</h3>

    <p>Chromium is an open source project, you are welcome to help out. We have
    <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/">documentation for developers</a> as well
    as mailing lists and an IRC channel.</p>
