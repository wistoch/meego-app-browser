// This file defines the "sync API", an interface to the syncer
// backend that exposes (1) the core functionality of maintaining a consistent
// local snapshot of a hierarchical object set; (2) a means to transactionally
// access and modify those objects; (3) a means to control client/server
// synchronization tasks, namely: pushing local object modifications to a
// server, pulling nonlocal object modifications from a server to this client,
// and resolving conflicts that may arise between the two; and (4) an
// abstraction of some external functionality that is to be provided by the
// host environment.
//
// This interface is used as the entry point into the syncer backend
// when the backend is compiled as a library and embedded in another
// application.  A goal for this interface layer is to depend on very few
// external types, so that an application can use the sync backend
// without introducing a dependency on specific types.  A non-goal is to
// have binary compatibility across versions or compilers; this allows the
// interface to use C++ classes.  An application wishing to use the sync API
// should ideally compile the syncer backend and this API as part of the
// application's own build, to avoid e.g. mismatches in calling convention,
// structure padding, or name mangling that could arise if there were a
// compiler mismatch.
//
// The schema of the objects in the sync domain is based on the model, which
// is essentially a hierarchy of items and folders similar to a filesystem,
// but with a few important differences.  The sync API contains fields
// such as URL to easily allow the embedding application to store web
// browser bookmarks.  Also, the sync API allows duplicate titles in a parent.
// Consequently, it does not support looking up an object by title
// and parent, since such a lookup is not uniquely determined.  Lastly,
// unlike a filesystem model, objects in the Sync API model have a strict
// ordering within a parent; the position is manipulable by callers, and
// children of a node can be enumerated in the order of their position.
