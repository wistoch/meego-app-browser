// Provides sqlite3-based persistence for a syncable::Directory object. You can
// load all the persisted data to prime a syncable::Directory on startup by
// invoking Load.  The only other thing you (or more correctly, a Directory)
// can do here is save any changes that have occurred since calling Load, which
// can be done periodically as often as desired*
//
// * If you only ever use a DirectoryBackingStore (DBS) from a single thread
// then you can stop reading now. This is implemented using sqlite3, which
// requires that each thread accesses a DB via a handle (sqlite3*) opened by
// sqlite_open for that thread and only that thread.  To avoid complicated TLS
// logic to swap handles in-and-out as different threads try to get a hold of a
// DBS, the DBS does two things:
// 1.  Uses a separate handle for Load()ing which is closed as soon as loading
//     finishes, and
// 2.  Requires that SaveChanges *only* be called from a single thread, and that
//     thread *must* be the thread that owns / is responsible for destroying
//     the DBS.
// This way, any thread may open a Directory (which today can be either the
// AuthWatcherThread or SyncCoreThread) and Load its DBS.  The first time
// SaveChanges is called a new sqlite3 handle is created, and it will get closed
// when the DBS is destroyed, which is the reason for the requirement that the
// thread that "uses" the DBS is the thread that destroys it.
