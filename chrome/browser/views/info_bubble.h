// InfoBubble is used to display an arbitrary view above all other windows.

// in the tooltip. Additionally the InfoBubble renders an arrow pointing at
// the region the info bubble is providing the information about.
//
// To use an InfoBubble, invoke Show() and it'll take care of the rest.  The
// InfoBubble insets the contents for you, so the contents typically shouldn't
// have any additional margins.
