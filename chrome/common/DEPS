  # TODO(erg): A previous version of this patch moved everything needed from
  # tab_contents/ to chrome/common/ but failed on the buildbot (but not locally
  # or on the trybots). Temporarily add this suppression as I commit what was a
  # very large patch piecewise, removing it with the final patch that will move
  # the files again and remove this override.
