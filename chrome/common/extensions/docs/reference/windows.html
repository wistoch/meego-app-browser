<!-- This page is a placeholder for generated extensions api doc. Note:
    1) The <head> information in this page is significant, should be uniform
       across api docs and should be edited only with knowledge of the
       templating mechanism.
    2) The <body> tag *must* retain id="body"
    3) All <body>.innerHTML is genereated as an rendering step. If viewed in a
       browser, it will be re-generated from the template, json schema and
       authored overview content.
    4) The <body>.innerHTML is also generated by an offline step so that this
       page may easily be indexed by search engines.
       
    TODO(rafaelw): Abstract this into a "pageshell" that becomes the single
    version of page template shell and the "instance" pages (bookmarks.html,
    etc...) can be generated with a build step.
