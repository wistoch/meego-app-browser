<div id="pageData-title" class="pageData">Browser Actions</div>

<!-- BEGIN AUTHORED CONTENT -->
<p>Browser actions are buttons
  that are displayed in the main Chrome toolbar
  to the right of the omnibox.</p>

<img src="images/browser-action.png"
  width="363" height="226" />

<h2 id="icons">Icons</h2>

<p>Browser action icons can be up to 19px square.
  Larger icons will be resized to fit, but for best results,
  using a 19px icon is recommended.</p>

<p>Icons can be set two ways:
  using a static image or using the
  HTML5 <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html">canvas element</a>.
  Using static images is easier for simple applications,
  but you can do more dynamic UIs
  using the canvas element.

<p>Static images can be in any format WebKit can display.
  These include: png, bmp, ico, jpg, gif.</p>

<h2 id="badges">Badges</h2>

<p>Browser actions can optionally display a badge,
  which is a bit of text that is layered over the icon.
  Badges make it easy to update the browser action
  to display a small amount of information
  about the state of the extension.</p>

<p>The badge APIs allow any length of text,
  but limiting badges to a max of four characters
  is recommended.</p>

<h2 id="popups">Popups</h2>

<p>Popups allow browser actions to show additional UI
  when the user activates them.
  Popups contents are implemented using HTML
  and the popup is automatically sized
  to the content size.</p>

<h2>Style Guide</h2>

<p>For the best visual impact,
  we recommend observing
  the following guidelines:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Do</b> use browser actions for features
    that make sense on most pages.
  <li><b>Don't</b> use browser actions for features
    that only make sense for a few pages.
    Use <a href="pageAction.html">page actions</a> instead.
  <li><b>Do</b> use big, colorful icons that fully utilize
    the 19px square space.
    Browser action icons should seem a little bigger
    and heavier than page action icons.
  <li><b>Don't</b> attempt to mimic
    Chrome's monochrome "wrench" and "page" icons.
    This won't work well with themes, and anyway,
    extensions should stand out a little.
  <li><b>Do</b> use alpha transparency
    to add soft edges to your icon.
    Remember: many users theme Chrome,
    so your icon should look nice
    on a variety of background colors.
  <li><b>Don't</b> constantly animate your icon.
    That's just annoying.
</ul>

<h2 id="manifest">Manifest</h2>

<p>Developers declare their browser action
  using the following syntax:</p>

<pre>"browser_action": {
  "default_title": "Google Mail",  // Optional. Shown in tooltip.
  "default_icon": "images/icon19.png",  // Optional.
  "popup": "popup.html"  // Optional
}</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b> Even if you don't include
  any of the values, you must include an empty
  browser_action entry in your manifest
  so that the system knows to reserve space
  for your browser action in the toolbar.</p>
