For information on how to use experimental APIs,
see the <a href="experimental.html">chrome.experimental.* APIs</a> page.
</p>

<h2 id="transition_types">Transition types</h2>

<p>
The history API uses a <em>transition type</em> to describe
how the browser navigated to a particular URL
on a particular visit.
For example, if a user visits a page
by clicking a link on another page,
the transition type is LINK.
To be precise,
the type is
<a href="#LINK"><code>chrome.experimental.history.transitionType.LINK</code></a>,
which has an integer value of 0.
</p>

<p class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
The spelling of
<code>transitionType</code> changed in
<a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=38850">revision 38850</a>.
Previously, it was <code>transistionType</code>.
</p>

<p>
The following table describes each transition type defined by
<code>chrome.experimental.history.transistionType</code>.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
  <th> Transition type </th> <th> Value </th> <th> Description </th>
</tr>
<tr id="LINK">
  <td>LINK</td> <td>0</td>
  <td>
    The user got to this page by clicking a link on another page.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr id="TYPED">
  <td>TYPED</td> <td>1</td>
  <td>
    The user got this page by typing the URL in the address bar.
    Also used for other explicit navigation actions.
    See also <a href="#GENERATED">GENERATED</a>,
    which is used for cases where the user selected a choice
    that didn't look at all like a URL.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr id="AUTO_BOOKMARK">
  <td>AUTO_BOOKMARK</td><td>2</td>
  <td>
    The user got to this page through a suggestion in the UI &mdash;
    for example, through a menu item.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr id="AUTO_SUBFRAME">
  <td>AUTO_SUBFRAME</td><td>3</td>
  <td>
    Subframe navigation.
    This is any content that is automatically
    loaded in a non-top-level frame.
    For example, if a page consists of
    several frames containing ads,
    those ad URLs have this transition type.
    The user may not even realize the content in these pages
    is a separate frame, and so may not care about the URL
    (see also <a href="#MANUAL_SUBFRAME">MANUAL_SUBFRAME</a>).
  </td>
</tr>
<tr id="MANUAL_SUBFRAME">
  <td>MANUAL_SUBFRAME</td><td>4</td>
  <td>
    For subframe navigations that are explicitly requested by the user
    and generate new navigation entries in the back/forward list.
    An explicitly requested frame is probably more important than
    an automatically loaded frame
    because the user probably cares about the fact that
    the requested frame was loaded.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr id="GENERATED">
  <td>GENERATED</td><td>5</td>
  <td>
    The user got to this page by typing in the address bar
    and selecting an entry that did not look like a URL.
    For example, a match might have the URL of a Google search result page,
    but it might appear to the user as "Search Google for ...".
    These are not quite the same as <a href="#TYPED">TYPED</a> navigations
    because the user didn't type or see the destination URL.
    See also <a href="#KEYWORD">KEYWORD</a>.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr id="START_PAGE">
  <td>START_PAGE</td><td>6</td>
  <td>
    The page was specified in the command line or is the start page.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr id="FORM_SUBMIT">
  <td>FORM_SUBMIT</td><td>7</td>
  <td>
    The user filled out values in a form and submitted it.
    Note that in some situations &mdash;
    such as when a form uses script to submit contents &mdash;
    submitting a form does not result in this transition type.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr id="RELOAD">
  <td>RELOAD</td><td>8</td>
  <td>
    The user reloaded the page,
    either by clicking the reload button
    or by pressing Enter in the address bar.
    Session restore and Reopen closed tab use this transition type, too.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr id="KEYWORD">
  <td>KEYWORD</td><td>9</td>
  <td>
    The URL was generated from a replaceable keyword
    other than the default search provider.
    See also
    <a href="#KEYWORD_GENERATED">KEYWORD_GENERATED</a>.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr id="KEYWORD_GENERATED">
  <td>KEYWORD_GENERATED</td><td>10</td>
  <td>
    Corresponds to a visit generated for a keyword.
    See also <a href="#KEYWORD">KEYWORD</a>.
  </td>
</tr>
