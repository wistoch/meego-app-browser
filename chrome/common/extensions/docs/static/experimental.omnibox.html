<p>The omnibox API allows you to register a
keyword with Google Chrome's omnibox.

<p><img src="omnibox.png" width="480" height="300">

<p>When the user enters your extension's
keyword, they enter a mode where they are
interacting solely with your extension.
Each of their keystrokes is sent to your
extension, and you can provide suggestions
in response.

<p>The suggestions can be richly formatted
in a variety of ways. When the user accepts
a suggestion, your extension is notified
and can take action.

<h2 id="manifest">Manifest</h2>

<p>To use the Omnibox API, your manifest must
declare the "experimental" permission and
register an omnibox keyword. You should also
specify a 16x16-pixel icon. This will get
displayed in the omnibox when suggesting users
enter keyword mode.

<p>For example:

<pre>{
  "name": "Aaron's omnibox extension",
  "version": "1.0",
  <b>"permissions": ["experimental"],</b>
  <b>"omnibox_keyword": "aaron",</b>
  <b>"icons": {</b>
    <b>"16": "16-full-color.png"</b>
  <b>},</b>
  "background_page": "background.html"
  
}</pre>

<p><b class="note">Note:</b> Google Chrome
automatically creates a greyscale version of
your 16x16-pixel icon. You should provide
a full-color version so that it can also be
used in other situations that require color.
For example, the <a href="contextMenus.html"
>Context Menus API</a> also uses a 16x16-pixel
icon, but it is displayed in color.

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>
You can find samples of this API on the
<a href="samples.html#omnibox">sample page</a>.
