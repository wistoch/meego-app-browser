This tutorial walks you through creating a simple extension.
To complete this tutorial, you must have Windows.
(Linux and Mac don't yet support extensions.)
</p>

<h2 id="browser">Get your browser ready</h2>

<p>
To develop extensions for Google Chrome, you need to set up your browser:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel">Subscribe
  to the Dev channel</a> of Google Chrome for Windows.  </li>
  <li><a href="http://dev.chromium.org/developers/creating-and-using-profiles">Create
    a separate profile</a> for testing
    <em>(optional but highly recommended)</em>.
    Having a testing profile means that you can use Google Chrome
    (with your default profile)
    for everyday browsing,
    even if your extension has horrible bugs.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="load">Create and load an extension</h2>
<p>
In this section, you'll write a <em>toolstrip</em> &mdash;
an extension
that puts a bit of UI into the <em>toolbar</em>
at the bottom of the Google Chrome window.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Create a folder somewhere on your computer to contain your extension's code.
    We'll assume the folder is located at
    <strong><code>c:\myext</code></strong>,
    but it can be anywhere.
  </li>
  <li>
    Inside your extension's folder,
    create a text file called <strong><code>manifest.json</code></strong>,
    and put this in it:
<pre>{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;My First Extension&quot;,
  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0&quot;,
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The first extension that I made.&quot;,
  &quot;toolstrips&quot;: [
    &quot;my_toolstrip.html&quot;
  ]
}</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    In the same folder, create a text file called
    <strong><code>my_toolstrip.html</code></strong>,
    and put this in it:
<pre>&lt;div class=&quot;toolstrip-button&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
  </li>
  <li> Load the extension:
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
      Change the shortcut that you use to start the browser
      (or create a new one)
      so that it has the 
      <code>--load-extension</code> flag.
      For example, if your extension is at <code>c:\myext</code>,
      your shortcut might look something like this:
<pre>chrome.exe <b>--load-extension="c:\myext"</b></pre>
      </li>
      <li>Exit Google Chrome.
      If you have a separate profile for testing,
      you only need to exit the browser instances that use the testing profile. </li>
      <li>Double-click the shortcut to start the browser.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    <b>Note:</b>
    To run already-packaged extensions
    the browser must be started with the
    <code>--enable-extensions</code> or <code>--load-extension</code> flag.
    An exception:
    themes run in the Dev channel version of Google Chrome,
    no flags required.
    For details on changing shortcut properties, see
    <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/developers/creating-and-using-profiles">Creating
    and Using Profiles</a>.
</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
You should see the UI for your extension at the bottom left of the browser, looking something like this:
</p>

<table class="imagelayout">
    <tbody>
      <tr class="images">
        <td width="33%"><img src="images/hw-1.gif"
                                        alt="" /></td>
        <td width="33%"><img src="images/hw-2.gif"
                                        alt="" /></td>
        <td width="33%"><img src="images/hw-3.gif"
                                        alt="" /></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="33%"> default appearance</td>
        <td width="33%"> initial onhover appearance</td>
        <td width="33%"> final onhover appearance</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

  <p>
  Your extension's button is automatically styled
  to look like it belongs in the browser.
  If you put the cursor over the button,
  the button gets a nice, rounded edge,
  just like the buttons in the bookmark bar.
  After a while, a tooltip comes up, identifying the extension.
  </p>
  <p> [PENDING: troubleshooting info should go here.
  what are symptoms of common typos, including misnamed files?
  what are the symptoms if you don't have the dev channel?] </p>

<h2 id="code">Add code to the extension</h2>
<p> In this step, you'll make your extension <em>do</em> something besides just look good. </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p> Inside your extension's folder,
    create a text file called <strong><code>hello_world.html</code></strong>,
    and add the following code to it:</p>
    <blockquote> <a href="samples/hello_world.txt">CSS
    and JavaScript code for hello_world</a></blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Edit <code>my_toolstrip.html</code>, so that it has the following code: </p>
    <pre>&lt;div class=&quot;toolstrip-button&quot;<b> onclick=&quot;window.open('hello_world.html')&quot;</b>&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Restart the browser to load the new version of the extension.</li>
  <li>Click the button.
  A window should come up that displays <code>hello_world.html</code>. </li>
</ol>
<p> It should look something like this:</p>

<img src="images/hello_world-page.gif" alt="a window with a grid of images related to HELLO WORLD" />

<p> If you don't see that page,
try the instructions again,
following them exactly.
Don't try loading an HTML file that isn't in the extension's folder &mdash;
it won't work! </p>

<h2 id="summary">Now what?</h2>

<p>
[PENDING: Summarize what we did,
what it means,
what else we would've done if this were a real extension (e.g. package it),
and where to find more information.]</p>
