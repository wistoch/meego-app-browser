<p> If you want to customize Google Chrome, you've come to the right place. An <em>extension</em> is a bundle of web code (HTML, JavaScript, perhaps some CSS) that lets you add functionality or a bit of user interface (usually both) to the browser. <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/extensions/samples">Examples of extensions</a> include a mail checker, a newsfeed subscriber, and a status monitor.<br>
