<p>
This page should perhaps be renamed from "overview" to "concepts". In any case, what I'd like to cover here is the conceptual underpinning of extensions, such as:

<ul>
  <li>Zip file of web pages
  <li>All resources accessible with a URL scheme
  <li>How IDs are generated
  <li>The manifest
  <li>The background page, how extensions are typically structured
  <li>Process model
  <li>Content scripts (lightweight, link off to other page for details)
  <li>Asynchronous APIs
  <li>Extension IDs, how they are generated
  <li>How packaging works at a high level (lightweight, link off to other page for details)
</ul>
