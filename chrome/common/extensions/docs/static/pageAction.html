<!-- BEGIN AUTHORED CONTENT -->
<p>Page actions are a simple way to represent actions that can be taken on a page ("Email this page", "Share with Facebook", etc).</p>

<p>
Page actions are displayed as icons on the right side of the OmniBox.
The RSS icon in the following screenshot
represents a page action
that lets you subscribe to
the RSS feed for the current page.
</p>

<img src="images/page-action.png"
  width="361" height="79" />

<h2 id="icons">Icons</h2>

<p>Page action icons can be
up to 19px square.
Larger icons will be
resized to fit,
but for best results,
using a 19px icon is recommended.</p>

<p>Icons can be set two ways:
using a static image
or using the HTML5 <a href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html">canvas element</a>.
Using static images is easier
for simple applications,
but you can do
more dynamic UIs
using the canvas element.

<p>Static images can be
in any format WebKit can display.
These include: png, bmp, ico, jpg, gif.</p>

<h2>Style Guide</h2>

<p>For the best visual impact,
we recommend observing
the following guidelines:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Do</b> use page actions
    for features that only make sense
    for a few pages.
  <li><b>Don't</b> use page actions
    for features that make sense
    for most pages.
    Use <a href="browserAction.html">browser actions</a> instead.
  <li><b>Do</b> use icons
    that are slightly lighter-weight
    than <a href="browserAction.html#icons">browser action icons</a>.
    Most icons that Chrome displays
    in the location bar
    are smaller than 19px.
    If the edge pixels are used,
    they are usually only used
    for a faint shadow.
  <li><b>Don't</b> constantly animate your icon.
    That's just annoying.
</ul>

<h2 id="manifest">Manifest</h2>

<p>Developers can declare page actions
  in the manifest
  using the following syntax:</p>

<pre>"page_action": {
  "default_title": "Do action",  // Optional, tooltip.
  "default_icon": "icons/foo.png"  // Optional, icon.
}</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b> Even if you don't include
  any of the values,
  you must include an empty page_action entry
  in your manifest so that the system knows
  to reserve space for your action
  in the omnibox.</p>
