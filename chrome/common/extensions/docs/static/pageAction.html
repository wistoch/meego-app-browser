<!-- BEGIN AUTHORED CONTENT -->
<p>
Use page actions to put icons inside the address bar.
Page actions represent actions
that can be taken on the current page,
but that aren't applicable to all pages.
Some examples:
"Subscribe to this page's RSS feed",
"Make a slideshow out of this page's photos".
<span class="comment">
[PENDING: check]
</span>
</p>

<p>
The RSS icon in the following screenshot
represents a page action
that lets you subscribe to
the RSS feed for the current page.
</p>

<img src="images/page-action.png"
  width="361" height="79" />

<p>
If you want your icon to always be visible,
use a <a href="browserAction.html">browser action</a> instead.
</p>


<h2 id="manifest">Manifest</h2>

<p>
Register your page action in the
<a href="manifest.html">extension manifest</a>
like this:
</p>

<pre>"page_action": {
  "default_title": "Do action",   <em>// optional; shown in tooltip</em>
  "default_icon": "icons/foo.png" <em>// optional</em>
}</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b> Even if you don't include
  any of the values,
  you must include an empty <b>page_action</b> entry
  in your manifest so that the system
  reserves space for your page action
  in the address bar.</p>

<h2 id="ui">Parts of the UI</h2>

<p>
Page actions have the same UI parts as browser actions &mdash;
icon, tooltip, badge, and popup &mdash;
with the addition that page actions can appear and disappear.
For information about the common UI parts,
read about the
<a href="browserAction.html#ui">browser action UI</a>.
</p>

<p>
You make a page action appear and disappear using the
<a href="#method-hide">hide()</a> and
<a href="#method-show">show()</a> methods, respectively.
</p>

<div class="comment">
[PENDING:
We should discuss how tabs and page actions are related.
All methods take a tab ID argument.
How do you get that tab ID?
What's the usual way of arranging the code that monitors pages?
Point to examples.]
</div>


<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>

<p>For the best visual impact,
follow these guidelines:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Do</b> use page actions
    for features that make sense
    for only a few pages.
  <li><b>Don't</b> use page actions
    for features that make sense
    for most pages.
    Use <a href="browserAction.html">browser actions</a> instead.
  <li><b>Do</b> use icons
    that are slightly lighter weight
    than <a href="browserAction.html#icon">browser action icons</a>.
    Most icons that Chrome displays
    in the location bar
    are smaller than 19 pixels.
    If the edge pixels are used,
    they are usually only used
    for a faint shadow.
  <li><b>Don't</b> constantly animate your icon.
    That's just annoying.
</ul>
