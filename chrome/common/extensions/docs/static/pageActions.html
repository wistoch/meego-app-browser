<h2>Manifest</h2>

<p>Developers can include page actions in the manifest using the following syntax:</p>

<pre>"page_actions": [
    {
      "id": "myaction",  // chosen by developer, and should be unique within their extension
      "name": "Do action",
      "icons": ["favicon.png", "favicon2.png"]
    }
  ]</pre>

<p>Supported icon image formats include for example png, bmp, ico, jpg, gif. If an image larger than 16x16 is specified, it will be resized to fit.</p>
