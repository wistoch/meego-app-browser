<div id="pageData-title" class="pageData">Page Actions</div>

<!-- BEGIN AUTHORED CONTENT -->
<p>Page actions are a simple way to represent actions that can be taken on a page ("Email this page", "Share with Facebook", etc).</p>

<h2>User interface</h2>
<p>Page actions are displayed as icons on the right side of the OmniBox.</p>

<h2>Manifest</h2>

<p>Developers can declare page actions in the manifest using the following syntax:</p>

<pre>"page_actions": [
    {
      "id": "myaction",     // Chosen by the developer. Should be unique within their extension.
      "name": "Do action",  // The page action name, also used as tooltip (unless overridden).
      "icons": ["favicon.png", "favicon2.png"]
    }
  ]</pre>

<p>Supported icon image formats include for example: png, bmp, ico, jpg, gif. If an image larger than 16x16 is specified, it will be resized to fit. For optimal performance, consider using an image that does not have to be resized to fit.</p>

<h2>Events</h2>

<p>Each page action displays an icon in the OmniBox. Whenever the user clicks the icon an event is sent to the extension, signifying that the user wants to apply an action to the current page. To receive notifications about the event, the extension must register a listener.</p>

<p>Page action events are created dynamically using the id of the page action declared in the manifest. For example, a page action with id 'foo' will setup an event called chrome.pageActions["foo"]. An extension would then register listeners like so:</p>

<pre>chrome.pageActions["foo"].addListener(function(object reply) {
  console.log(reply.pageActionId);  // Display the id of the page action.
  console.log(reply.data.tabId);    // Display the id of the tab for which the page action event applies.
  console.log(reply.data.tabUrl);   // Display the URL of the page for which the page action event applies.
});</pre>

<p style="margin-left:25px;"><strong>Parameters</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:25px;"><i>reply ( object )</i><br>

<p style="margin-left:50px;"><i>data ( object )</i><br>

<p style="margin-left:75px;"><i>tabId ( string )</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The id of the tab that was active when the event was triggered.</p>
<p style="margin-left:75px;"><i>tabUrl ( string )</i><br>
