<p>
Toolstrips allow you to add UI to Google Chrome's toolbar area.
Toolstrips are nothing more than (very small) HTML pages,
so anything you can do with HTML/CSS/JavaScript,
you can do with toolstrips.
</p>

<h2 id="manifest">Manifest</h2>
<p>Register your toolstrips in the extension manifest like this:</p>

<pre>{
  "name": "My First Extension",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "The first extension that I made.",
<b>  "toolstrips": [
    "one_toolstrip.html",
    "two_toolstrip.html"
  ]</b>
}</pre>

<h2>Creating buttons</h2>
<p>You can create buttons that look like the bookmark bar buttons using this template:</p>

<pre>&lt;div class="toolstrip-button"&gt;
  &lt;!-- Image is optional and should be a 16x16 icon. --&gt;
  &lt;img src="<em>path/to/some_icon.png</em>">
  &lt;span&gt;My Button&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>


<h2>Debugging tips</h2>

<ul>
<li>You can bring up the web inspector for a toolstrip by going to chrome://extensions and clicking on the 'inspect' link.  This includes a javascript console as well as a debugger.</li>
<li>alert(), prompt(), and confirm() don't work yet. Sorry about that.</li>
<li>You can run toolstrips in the main content area by loading their URL, which would be something like chrome-extension://0000000000000000000000000000000000000000/my_toolstrip.html</li>
</ul>

<h2>Design tips</h2>

<ul>
<li>Try not to use too much space. Toolbar real estate is precious and users tend to prefer extensions to use as little of it as possible.</li>
<li>The toolbar automatically detects how much space a toolstrip needs and reflows. So you can resize your toolstrip dynamically if you need a little more room temporarily.</li>
<li>If you need to do more extensive UI, use the tab contents area or a pop up window.</li>
<li>Remember that there can be multiple instances of a given toolstrip page running at one time. Each browser window has its own toolstrip. If you need long-running application logic, try Background Pages.</li>
</ul>
