<div id="pageData-title" class="pageData">Tutorial: Debugging</div>

<p>
[PENDING: intro goes here.
This tutorial starts where
<a href="getstarted.html">Getting Started</a> ends.
Point to files needed.]
</p>

<p>
You can use the browser's built-in developer tools
to view your extension's code,
display debugging output,
and debug your extension.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p> Edit <code>my_toolstrip.html</code>, so that it has the following code: </p>
<pre><span class="newCode">&lt;script&gt;
function helloWorld() {
  var hwFile = 'hello_world.html';
  console.log(&quot;in helloWorld()&quot;);
  window.open(hwFile);
}
&lt;/script&gt;</span>

&lt;div class=&quot;toolstrip-button&quot; onclick=&quot;<span class="newCode">helloWorld();</span>&quot;&gt;
&lt;span&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
    <p> The relocated code still has the same effect,
    but now it has some debugging output,
    thanks to the call to <code>console.log()</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  Restart the browser, so that it loads your new version of the extension.

<!--
This might be confusing.
Maybe we should instead cover location.reload() later,
after we've shown the console.
  <div class="note">
  <b>Tip:</b>
  If you don't want to restart your browser,
  you can get an updated version of the extension
  by opening a new window.
  The new window will contain the updated extension;
  old windows will contain the old version.
  </div>
-->
  </li>
  <li>
  Right-click the <strong>Hello, World!</strong> button
  (at the bottom left)
  to bring up the Developer Tools window
  for this instance of your toolstrip.
  The window should look something like this:
  <p>
     <img src="images/devtools-1.gif" alt="" />  </p>
<!--
Possibly we should recommend starting the Dev Tools
using chrome://extensions, rather than right-click.
However, that adds some stuff (such as id)
that might be confusing.
-->

  </li>
  <li>
  Click the <strong>Scripts</strong> button.
  If necessary, choose <strong>my_toolstrip.html</strong>
  from the list of scripts.
  The result should be something like this:
  <p>
  <img src="images/devtools-2.gif" alt="" />  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  Set a debugging breakpoint at the <code>window.open()</code> statement
  by clicking <strong>5</strong> in the left column:
  <p>
  <img src="images/devtools-3.gif" alt="" />  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  Click the Console button
  (second from left, at the bottom of the Developer Tools window)
  so that you can see both the code and the console.
  <p>
  <img src="images/devtools-4.gif" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  Back in the main browser window,
  click the <strong>Hello, World!</strong> button,
  so that the extension begins executing.
  You should see the output of <code>console.log()</code>
  along with the line number,
  and execution should stop just before
  the call to <code>window.open()</code>.
  <p>
  <img src="images/devtools-5.gif" alt="" />
  </p>

  <p>
  The Call Stack area at the right of the tools window shows that
  the <code>helloWorld()</code> method was called by an anonymous function
  that was called by <code>onclick</code>.
  Anywhere in the Call Stack or console that you see a file and line number
  (for example, &quot;my_toolstrip.html:4&quot;),
  you can click that text to see the relevant line of code.  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  In the upper right part of the tools window,
  scroll down (if necessary) until you can see the local scope variables.
  This section shows the current values of all variables in the current scope.
  For example, you can see that <code>hwFile</code> is a local variable
  that has the value &quot;hello_world.html&quot;.
  <p>
  <img src="images/devtools-6.gif" alt="" />  </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  Click the buttons at the upper right of the window
  to resume execution or to step through the code.
  Once the call to <code>window.open()</code> returns,
  the main browser window should open a new tab
  that displays the contents of <code>hello_world.html</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>
You now know how to load and debug an extension!</p>
