<p>
This tutorial introduces you to using
Google Chrome's built-in Developer Tools
to interactively debug an extension.
</p>


<h2 id="extension-info"> View extension information </h2>

<p>
To follow this tutorial, you need
the Hello World extension that was featured in
<a href="getstarted.html">Getting Started</a>.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Load the Hello World extension if it isn't already running.
      If the extension is running,
      you'll see the Hello World icon
      <img src="examples/tutorials/getstarted/icon.png"
           width="19" height="19" alt=""
           style="margin:0" />
      to the right of
      your browser's address bar.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the Hello World extension isn't already running,
      find the extension files and load them.
      If you don't have a handy copy of the files,
      extract them from this
      <a href="examples/tutorials/getstarted/getstarted.zip">ZIP file</a>.
      See Getting Started if you need
      <a href="getstarted.html#load-ext">instructions
      for loading the extension</a>.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  Go to the Installed Extensions page
  (<b>chrome://extensions</b>),
  and make sure the page is in Developer mode.
  </li>

  <li>
  Look at the Hello World extension's information on that page.
  You can see details such as the extension's
  name, description, and ID.

<p class="comment">
[PENDING: screenshot here?]
</p>

  </li>

  <li>
  Keeping an eye on the Installed Extensions page,
  click the Hello World extension's icon
  <img src="examples/tutorials/getstarted/icon.png"
       width="19" height="19" alt=""
       style="margin:0" />.
  A popup appears,
  and a link named <b>popup.html</b> appears in extension's information,
  under a new "Inspect active views:" heading.

  <p>
  <img src="images/debug-popup.png"
       width="" height="" alt="" />

  </li>
</ol>

<p>
Normally, you can inspect a page
by clicking its link in the Installed Extensions page.
However, clicking the link for a popup just
makes the popup disappear.
(This happens because a popup goes away as soon as it loses the keyboard focus.)
The next section shows how you can inspect popup pages.
</p>


<h2 id="inspect-popup"> Inspect the popup </h2>

<p>
Using the <b>chrome-extension</b> protocol,
you can view any file in your extension.
<span class="comment">
[PENDING: check]
</span>
This feature is especially handy for debugging popups.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
  Get the ID for the Hello World extension
  from the Installed Extensions page.
  Example: <b>opnnhifacfpohionnikhlecfgheooenk</b>
  </li>

  <li>
  Open a new tab or window,
  and enter the following in the address box:

  <blockquote>
  <b>chrome-extension://</b><em>extensionId</em><b>/popup.html</b>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
  You should see a full-page version of the popup's contents,
  like the following:
  </p>

  <p>
  <img src="images/debug-popup-tab.png"
       width="" height="" alt="" />
  </p>

  <li>
  Back in the Installed Extensions page,
  press <b>F5</b> or click the browser's Reload button
  to update the Hello World extension's information.
  <span class="comment">[PENDING: this seems like it should be unnecessary --
  like the page should update itself]</span>
  </li>

  <li>
  Click the link to <b>popup.html</b>.
  A Developer Tools window like the following should appear,
  displaying the code for <b>popup.html</b>.

  <p>
     <img src="images/devtools-1.png" alt=""
          width="669" height="394" />
     </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  If the <strong>Scripts</strong> button isn't already selected,
  click it.
  <span class="comment">[PENDING: can we omit this step?]</span>
  </li>
  <li>
  Click the console button
  <img src="images/console-button.gif"
       style="border:1px black solid"
       width="18" height="14" alt=""
       style="margin:0" />
  (second from left, at the bottom of the Developer Tools window)
  so that you can see both the code and the console.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="debug"> Use the debugger </h2>

<p>
In this section,
you'll follow the execution of the popup page
as it adds images to itself.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
  Set a breakpoint inside the image-adding loop
  by searching for the string <b>img.src</b>
  and clicking the number of the line where it occurs
  (for example, <strong>37</strong>):
  <p>
  <img src="images/devtools-2.png" alt=""
       width="669" height="394" />
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  Make sure you can see the <b>popup.html</b> tab.
  It should show 20 "hello world" images.
  </li>

  <li>
  At the console prompt, reload the popup page
  by entering <b>location.reload()</b>:

<pre>
> <b>location.reload()</b>
</pre>

  <p>
  The popup page goes blank as it begins to reload,
  and its execution stops at line 37.
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  In the upper right part of the tools window,
  you should see the local scope variables.
  This section shows the current values of all variables in the current scope.
  For example, in the following screenshot
  the value of <code>i</code> is 0, and
  <code>photos</code> is a <code>NodeList</code>
  that contains at least one <code>Element</code>.
  (In fact, it contains 20 elements at indexes 0 through 19,
  each one representing a photo.)

  <p>
  <img src="images/devtools-localvars.png" alt=""
       width="226" height="123" />
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  Click the play/pause button
  <img src="images/play-button.gif"
       style="border:1px black solid"
       width="14" height="12" alt="" />
  (near the top right of the Developer Tools window)
  to go through the image-processing loop a single time.
  Each time you click that button,
  the value of <code>i</code> increments and
  another icon appears in the popup page.
  For example, when <code>i</code> is 10,
  the popup page looks something like this:
  </li>

  <p>
  <img src="images/devtools-3.png"
       width="723" height="270"
       alt="the popup page with 10 images" />
  </p>

  <li>
  Use the buttons next to the play/pause button
  to step over, into, and out of function calls.
  To let the page finish loading,
  click line <b>37</b> to disable the breakpoint,
  and then press play/pause
  <img src="images/play-button.gif"
       style="border:1px black solid"
       width="14" height="12" alt="" />
  to continue execution.
  </li>

</ol>


<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>
This tutorial demonstrated some techniques you can use
to debug your extensions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Find your extension's ID and links to its pages in
    the <b>Installed Extensions</b> page
    (<b>chrome://extensions</b>).
  </li>
  <li>
    View hard-to-reach pages
    (and any other file in your extension) using
    <b>chrome-extension://</b><em>extensionId</em><b>/</b><em>filename</em>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use Developer Tools to inspect
    and step through a page's JavaScript code.
  </li>
  <li>
    Reload the currently inspected page from the console
    using <b>location.reload()</b>.
  </li>
</ul>


<h2 id="next">Now what?</h2>

<p>
Now that you've been introduced to debugging,
here are suggestions for what to do next:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Try installing and inspecting other extensions,
    such as the
    <a href="samples.html">samples</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Try using widely available debugging APIs such as
    <code>console.log()</code> and <code>console.error()</code>
    in your extension's JavaScript code.
    Example: <code>console.log("Hello, world!")</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    Explore the
    <a href="http://www.chromium.org/devtools">Developer Tools site</a>,
    and watch some video tutorials.
  </li>
</ul>
