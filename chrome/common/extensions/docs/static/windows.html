<h2 id="current-window">The current window</h2>

<p>Many functions in the extension system
take an optional <var>windowId</var> parameter
which is documented to default to the <em>current window</em>.

<p>The current window is the window that
contains the code that is currently executing.
It's important to realize that this can be
different from the topmost or focused window.

<p>For example, consider code running in a
<a href="toolstrip.html">toolstrip</a>, that
calls <a href="tabs.html#method-getSelected">chrome.tabs.getSelected</a>.
The current window is the window that contains the toolstrip that made
the call, no matter what the topmost window is.

<p>In the case of the <a href="background_pages.html">background page</a>,
the value of the current window falls back to the topmost window.
