Use the <code>chrome.windows</code> module
to interact with browser windows.
You can use this module to
create, modify, and rearrange windows in the browser.

<h2 id="manifest">Manifest</h2>
<p>
To use the windows API,
you must declare the "tabs" permission
in <a href="manifest.html">manifest.json</a>.
(No, that isn't a typo &mdash;
the window and tabs modules interact so closely we
decided to just share one permission between them.)
For example:
</p>
<pre>
"permissions": ["tabs"]
</pre>

<h2 id="current-window">The current window</h2>

<p>Many functions in the extension system
take an optional <var>windowId</var> parameter,
which defaults to the current window.
</p>

<p>The <em>current window</em> is the window that
contains the code that is currently executing.
It's important to realize that this can be
different from the topmost or focused window.
</p>

<p>For example, say an extension
creates a few tabs or windows from a single HTML file,
and that the HTML file
contains a call to
<a href="tabs.html#method-getSelected">chrome.tabs.getSelected</a>.
The current window is the window that contains the page that made
the call, no matter what the topmost window is.
</p>

<p>In the case of the <a href="background_pages.html">background page</a>,
the value of the current window falls back to the topmost window.
