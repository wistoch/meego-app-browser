<p>The standard XMLHttpRequest object can be used to communicate with multiple origins (ie domains) from an extension. You must pre-register the domains you want to talk to in the manifest, like so:</p>

<pre>{
  "name": "My First Extension",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "The first extension that I made.",
  "permissions": [
    "http://www.blogger.com",
    "http://*.google.com"
  ]
}</pre>

<h3>Status</h3>
<p>Implemented, but we don't yet enforce the permissions; all origins are allowed for now.</p>
