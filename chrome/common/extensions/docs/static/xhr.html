<p id="classSummary">
Regular web pages can use the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/">XMLHttpRequest</a>
object to send and receive data from remote servers,
but they're limited by the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy">same origin policy</a>.
Extensions aren't so limited.
An extension can talk to remote servers outside of its origin,
as long as it first requests cross-origin permissions.</p>

<h2 id="extension-origin">Extension origin</h2>
<p>Each running extension exists within its own separate security origin. Without
requesting additional privileges, the extension can use
XMLHttpRequest to get resources within its installation. For example, if
an extension contains a JSON configuration file called <code>config.json</code>,
in a <code>config_resources</code> folder, the extension can retrieve the file's contents like
this:</p>

<pre>
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.onreadystatechange = handleStateChange; // Implemented elsewhere.
xhr.open("GET", chrome.extension.getURL('/config_resources/config.json'), true);
xhr.send();
</pre>

<p>If the extension attempts to use a security origin other than itself,
say http://www.google.com,
the browser disallows it
unless the extension has requested the appropriate cross-origin permissions.
</p>

<h2 id="requesting-permission">Requesting cross-origin permissions</h2>

<p>By adding hosts or host match patterns (or both) to the
<a href="manifest.html#permissions">permissions<a> section of the 
<a href="manifest.html">manifest</a> file, the extension can request access to 
remote servers outside of its origin.</p>

<pre>"permissions": [
  "http://www.google.com/",
],
</pre>

<p>Cross-origin permission values can be fully qualified host names,
like these:</p>

<ul>
  <li> "http://www.google.com/" </li>
  <li> "http://www.gmail.com/" </li>
</ul>

<p>Or they can be match patterns, like these:</p>

<ul>
  <li> "http://*.google.com/" </li>
  <li> "http://*/" </li>
</ul>

<p>
A match pattern of "http://*/" allows HTTP access to all reachable domains.
Note that here,
match patterns are similar to <a href="match_patterns.html">content script
match patterns</a>,
but any path information following the host is ignored.</p>

<p>Also note that access is granted both by host and by scheme. If an extension
wants both secure and non-secure HTTP access to a given host or set
of hosts, it must declare the permissions separately:</p>

<pre>"permissions": [
  "http://www.google.com/",
  "https://www.google.com/",
],
</pre>
