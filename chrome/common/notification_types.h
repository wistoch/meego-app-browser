enum NotificationType {
  // General -------------------------------------------------------------------

  // Special signal value to represent an interest in all notifications.
  // Not valid when posting a notification.
  NOTIFY_ALL = 0,

  // The app is done processing user actions, now is a good time to do
  // some background work.
  NOTIFY_IDLE,

  // Means that the app has just started doing something in response
  // to a user action, and that background processes shouldn't run if avoidable.
  NOTIFY_BUSY,

  // This is sent when the user does a gesture resulting in a noteworthy
  // action taking place. This is typically used for logging. The
  // source is the profile, and the details is a wstring identifying the action.
  NOTIFY_USER_ACTION,

  // NavigationController ------------------------------------------------------

  // A new pending navigation has been created. Pending entries are created when
  // the user requests the navigation. We don't know if it will actually happen
  // until it does (at this point, it will be "committed." Note that renderer-
  // initiated navigations such as link clicks will never be pending.
  //
  // This notification is called after the pending entry is created, but before
  // we actually try to navigate. The source will be the NavigationController
  // that owns the pending entry, and there are no details.
  NOTIFY_NAV_ENTRY_PENDING,

  NOTIFY_NAV_ENTRY_COMMITTED,

  // Indicates that the NavigationController given in the Source has decreased
  // its back/forward list count by removing entries from either the front or
  // back of its list. This is usually the result of going back and then doing a
  // new navigation, meaning all the "forward" items are deleted.
  //
  // This normally happens as a result of a new navigation. It will be followed
  // by a NOTIFY_NAV_ENTRY_COMMITTED message for the new page that caused the
  // pruning. It could also be a result of removing an item from the list to fix
  // up after interstitials.
  //
  // The details are NavigationController::PrunedDetails.
  NOTIFY_NAV_LIST_PRUNED,

  // Indicates that a NavigationEntry has changed. The source will be the

  // for NOTIFY_NAV_ENTRY_COMMITTED to handle that case. This will be sent when
  // the entry is updated outside of navigation (like when a new title comes).
