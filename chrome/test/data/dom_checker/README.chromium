This directory contains DOM checker, a tool to help automatically validate
domain security policy enforcement. This tool will check cross-domain DOM
accesses, JavaScript cookies, XMLHttpRequest calls, and more.

DOM checker was written by Michal Zalewski and Filipe Almeida of Google.

Version: 1.01

Modifications:
  - Modified dom_config.js to work with the test configuration setup.
  - Added bookkeeping variables to dom_checker.html. These variables track the
    total number of tests ran and the failed tests. This data is written to
    cookies, which will be picked up by the test executable.
  - Modified dom_checker.html to not complain when running the test on a
    specified port other than the default port.
  - Modified dom_checker.html to start the tests immediately on page load,
    rather than waiting for the user to click on a button.
  - Removed trailing whitespace in all files.
  - Added extra_utils.js to contain extra utility functions needed to help with
    automating the test. Included this file in dom_checker.html.
  - Added expected_failures.txt to contain a list of expected failures. The
    test is considered "passing" if there are no failures not in the expected
    failure list.
