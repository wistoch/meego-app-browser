# This file contains known patterns of crash signatures. One pattern per line.
#
# A crash signature is the concatenation of the top N functions, delimited by
# '___', in chrome.dll on the crash stack. All characters are lower case.
#
# We use crash signature patterns as our list of known crashes. A crash
# signature pattern is a string that can be used to identify a known crash. We
# use the notion of patterns because crashes with the same root cause can often
# differ somewhat in their crash stacks. A pattern is intended to be a
# generalized, yet still identifying, form of a particular crash. Usually a
# pattern will contain part of a crash signature, for example a prefix, but it
# can be more sophisticated, such as a regular expression. See below for more
# details.
#
# The format of known crashes in this file is as follows:
#   TYPE : PATTERN
#
# PATTERN: A crash signature pattern is a potentially identifying string that
#          can be used to match a crash signature.
# TYPE: The type of the pattern, indicates how the pattern should be matched
#       against crash signatures. Possible options are:
#           PREFIX: Match any signature beginning with this pattern.
#           SUBSTRING: Match any signature containing this pattern.
#           REGEX: Use this pattern as a regex to match against signatures.
#       If the type is not listed, it defaults to PREFIX.

# about:crash is a test page.
PREFIX : abouthandler::aboutcrash

# Any crash due to out of memory is ignored.
PREFIX : `anonymous namespace'::onnomemory

# It is too broad to exclude all purecall related crashes. Thus here we filter
# any purecall crash immediately after runtask.
SUBSTRING : purecall___messageloop::runtask
REGEX : purecall___[^_]*___messageloop::runtask
REGEX : `anonymous namespace'::purecall$

# Ditto for InvalidParameter.  Unfortunately, we see a crash where that call
# is the only one on the stack, so ignore that instance
REGEX : `anonymous namespace'::invalidparameter$
