Version: 3

Modifications:
  - Included v8_benchmark_uitest.js in run.html. This file provides an
    interface between the benchmark and the test automation.
  - Added json2.js, a parser/stringifier for JSON in JavaScript. This is used
    to stringify results for consumption by the test automation. Included this
    file in run.html.
  - Modified run.html to call automation functions as necessary.
