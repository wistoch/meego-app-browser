// Get memory information for the process with given process ID.
//
// The Windows psapi provides memory information of a process through structure
// RPROCESS_MEMORY_COUNTERS_EX. Relevant fields are:
// PagefileUsage: private (not shared) committed virtual space in process.
//                This is "VM Size" in task manager processes tab.
// PeakPagefileUsage: peak value of PagefileUsage.
// WorkingSetSize: physical memory allocated to process including shared pages.
//                 This is "Memory Usage" in task manager processes tab.
//                 Contrary to its name, this value is not much useful for
//                 tracking the memory demand of an application.
// PeakWorkingSetSize: peak value of WorkingSetSize.
//                     This is "Peak Memory Usage" in task manager processes
//                     tab.
// PrivateUsage: The current amount of memory that cannot be shared with other
//               processes. Private bytes include memory that is committed and
//               marked MEM_PRIVATE, data that is not mapped, and executable
//               pages that have been written to. It usually gives the same
//               value as PagefileUsage. No equivalent part in task manager.
//
// The measurements we use are PagefileUsage (returned by current_virtual_size)
// and PeakPagefileUsage (returned by peak_virtual_size), Working Set and
// Peak working Set.
