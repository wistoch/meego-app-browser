This is a partial copy of Hunspell 1.1.5, with the following changes:
* '#include "config.h"' removed from src/hunspell/hunspell.hxx
* '#include "config.h"' removed from src/hunspell/license.hunspell
* Two unreferenced local variables removed from src/hunspell/suggestmgr.cxx
* src/hunspell/utf_info.cxx moved to src/hunspell/utf_info.hxx, and #include
  reference in src/hunspell/csutil.cxx changed accordingly
* Change the input params of the constructors to receive a FILE* instead of
  a file path. This is required to use hunspell in the sandbox.
* Remove all HUNSPELL_WARNING parameters since we are not using HashMgr
  anymore, just show the msg not the line number.
* Remove the key variable from Hunspell, HashMgr and AffixMgr since Bdict
  is being used instead.

The English dictionary distributed by Firefox has been checked in to the
dictionaries directory. It has several additions over the default
myspell/hunspell dictionary.
