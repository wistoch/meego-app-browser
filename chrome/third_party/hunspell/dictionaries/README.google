This Folder contains the following:

.dic files
.aff files
.bdic files
.dic_delta files

The .bdic files are binary files, generated from the corresponding .dic and .aff files, using convert_dict (chrome\tools\convert_dict). These binary files are used by the spellchecker. The .dic_delta files are used to add words which are not there in the .dic files. The final binary file, .bdic, is generated with words from the .dic and additional words from the .dic_delta file.

In order to get the current-most bdic file versions, it is a good idea to rebuild them using convert_dict from the .dic, .aff and .dic_delta files in this folder.

The following 20 dictionaries have been appended with additional words using the .dic_delta files (January 5th 2009):
