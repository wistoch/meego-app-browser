# Try to clean up old versions that are not in use.  The strategy is to keep
# the versioned directory corresponding to the update just applied
# (obviously) and the version that was just replaced, and to use ps and lsof
# to see if it looks like any processes are currently using any other old
# directories.  Directories not in use are removed.  Old versioned directories
# that are in use are left alone so as to not interfere with running
# processes.  These directories can be cleaned up by this script on future
# updates.
#
# To determine which directories are in use, both ps and lsof are used.  Each
# approach has limitations.
#
# The ps check looks for processes within the verisoned directory.  Only
# helper processes, such as renderers, are within the versioned directory.
# Browser processes are not, so the ps check will not find them, and will
# assume that a versioned directory is not in use if a browser is open without
# any windows.  The ps mechanism can also only detect processes running on the
# system that is performing the update.  If network shares are involved, all
# bets are off.
#
# The lsof check looks to see what processes have the framework dylib open.
# Browser processes will have their versioned framework dylib open, so this
# check is able to catch browsers even if there are no associated helper
# processes.  Like the ps check, the lsof check is limited to processes on
# the system that is performing the update.  Finally, unless running as root,
# the lsof check can only find processes running as the effective user
# performing the update.
#
# These limitations are motiviations to additionally preserve the versioned
# directory corresponding to the version that was just replaced.

# Set the nullglob option.  This causes a glob pattern that doesn't match
# any files to expand to an empty string, instead of expanding to the glob
# pattern itself.  This means that if /path/* doesn't match anything, it will
# expand to "" instead of, literally, "/path/*".  The glob used in the loop
# below is not expected to expand to nothing, but nullglob will prevent the
# loop from trying to remove nonexistent directories by weird names with
# funny characters in them.
