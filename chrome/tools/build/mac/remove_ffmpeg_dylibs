# Remove obsolete FFmpeg shared libraries.  Previously, there were three
# prebuilt FFmpeg libraries checked in as binaries, and they were copied into
# the framework's Libraries directory.  Since trunk 31050, they have been
# replaced by the single library libffmpegsumo.dylib (love the name), built
# from source during a normal build.
#
# TODO(mark): Remove after November 19, 2009, allowing two weeks for the
# transition.
