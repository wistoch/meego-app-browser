"""Script to verify a Portable Executable's dependencies.

Analyzes the input portable executable (a DLL or an EXE for example), extracts
its imports and confirms that its dependencies haven't changed. This is for
regression testing.

Returns 0 if the list matches.
        1 if one or more dependencies has been removed.
        2 if one or more dependencies has been added. This preempts removal
          result code.
