You want to be very careful about updating the reference builds, because it
means changing the baseline all new builds are compared to on the performance
graphs and can easily let regressions slip in.

The Chromium and Google Chrome builds the same revisions so you can compare
Google Chrome and Chromium performance data.

For the Google Chrome build, you need to disable Keystone within the build so
the bots won't have it updated to more recent builds (just remove the framework
and nuke the plist keys).
