# It is used to override the Chrome Frame appid, as well as
# add extra required source files and defines. The file is checked in as
# rename_me_to_supplement.gypi so as to not be active on the official builder.
# This is required because with these fields present, Chrome will build in
# Chrome Frame mode, which isn't what the Chrome official builder wants yet.
#
# Renaming this file to supplement.gypi will cause gyp to pick it up. 
# supplement.gypi is a magic gyp include file that gets pulled in before any
# other includes. 
#
# The official builder will define these extra vars and whatnot in the build
# scripts themselves.
