// A clock represent a single source of time to allow audio and video streams
// to synchronize with each other.  Clocks essentially track the media time with

// audio hardware or some other OS-level API.

// Clocks start off paused with a playback rate of 1.0f and a media time of 0.

// TODO(scherkus): Clocks will some day be responsible for executing callbacks
// given a media time.  This will be used primarily by video renderers.  For now
// we'll keep using a poll-and-sleep solution.
