// An abstract class to define the behavior of an output buffer sink for
// media::OmxCodec. It is responsible for negotiation of buffer allocation
// for output of media::OmxCodec. It is also responsible for processing buffer
// output from OpenMAX decoder. It is important to note that implementor must
// assure usage of this class is safe on the thread where media::OmxCodec
// lives. Ownership of this object is described in src/media/omx/omx_codec.h.
//
// BUFFER NEGOTIATION
//
// One of the key function of OmxOutputSink is to negotiate output buffer
// allocation with OmxCodec. There are two modes of operation:
//
// 1. Buffer is provided by OmxCodec.
//
// In this case ProvidesEGLImage() will return false and OmxCodec allocates
// output buffers during initialization. Here's a sample sequence of actions:
//
// - OmxCodec allocated buffers during initialization.
// - OmxOutputSink::UseThisBuffer(id, buffer) is called to assign an output
//   buffer header to the sink component.
// - OmxOutputSink maps the output buffer as a texture for rendering.
// - OmxCodec received dynamic port reconfiguration from the hardware.
// - OmxOutputSink::StopUsingThisBuffer(id) is called to release the buffer.
// - OmxOutputSink unmaps the output buffer as texture and make sure there
//   is not reference to it.
// - OmxOutputSink::UseThisBuffer(id, buffer) is called to assign a new
//   output buffer to the sink component.
// - ...
//
// 1. Buffer is provided by OmxCodec as EGL image.
//
// - OmxOutputSink::AllocateEGLImages(...) is called to request an EGL image
//   from the sink component, an associated buffer header is created.
// - OmxOutputSink::UseThisBuffer(id, buffer) is called to assign an output
//   buffer header to the sink component.
// - OmxOutputSink maps the output buffer as a texture for rendering.
// - OmxCodec received dynamic port reconfiguration from the hardware.
// - OmxOutputSink::StopUsingThisBuffer(id) is called to release the buffer.
// - OmxOutputSink unmaps the output buffer as texture and make sure there
//   is not reference to it.
// - OmxOutputSink::ReleaseEGLImages() is called to tell the sink component
//   to release all allocated EGL images.
// - OmxOutputSink::AllocateEGLImages(...) is called to allocate EGL images.
// - ...
//
// BUFFER READY SIGNALING
//
// Another key part of OmxOutputSink is to process the output buffer given
// by OmxCodec. This is done by signaling the sink component that a
// particular buffer is ready.
//
// This is done through the following sequence:
//
// - Owner of this object calls BufferReady(buffer_id, callback).
// - OmxOutputSink uses the buffer for rendering or other operations
//   asynchronously.
// - Callback provided by BufferReady() is called along with a buffer id to
//   notify the buffer has been consumed.
//
// It is up to implementor to decide which thread this callback is executed.
//
// THREADING
//
// OmxOutputSink::BufferReady(buffer_id) is called from the owner of this
// object which can be made from any thread. All other methods are made on
// the thread where OmxCodec lives.
//
// When the sink component is notified of buffer ready and the buffer is
// used BufferUsedCallback is called. There is no gurantee which thread
// this call is made.
//
// OWNERSHIP
//
// Described in src/media/omx/omx_codec.h.
