// Winsock initialization must happen before any Winsock calls are made.  This
// class provides a wrapper for WSAStartup and WSACleanup. There are 3 ways to
// use it: either allocate a new WinsockInit object at startup and delete when
// shutting down, manually call Init and Cleanup, or use the EnsureWinsockInit
// method, which may be called multiple times.  In the second case, Cleanup
// should only be called if Init was successful.
