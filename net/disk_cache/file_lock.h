// This class implements a file lock that lives on the header of a memory mapped
// file. This is NOT a thread related lock, it is a lock to detect corruption
// of the file when the process crashes in the middle of an update.
// The lock is acquired on the constructor and released on the destructor.
// The typical use of the class is:
//    {
//      BlockFileHeader* header = GetFileHeader();
//      FileLock lock(header);
//      header->max_entries = num_entries;
//      // At this point the destructor is going to release the lock.
//    }
// It is important to perform Lock() and Unlock() operations in the right order,
// because otherwise the desired effect of the "lock" will not be achieved. If
// the operations are inlined / optimized, the "locked" operations can happen
// outside the lock.
