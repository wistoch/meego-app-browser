  * Cache the peer's intermediate CA certificates in session ID, so that
    they're available when we resume a session.
    patches/cachecerts.patch

  * List TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA after TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA
    in ClientHello to communicate securely with some servers that use
    256-bit DH keys.  Remove this patch when we upgrade to NSS 3.12.7,
    which rejects DH keys shorter than 512 bits.

The ssl/bodge directory contains files taken from the NSS repo that we required
for building libssl outside of its usual build environment.
