This directory includes a copy of NSS's libssl from the CVS repo at:
  :pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:/cvsroot

The snapshot was taken at Thu Nov 12 17:19:36 PST 2009.

There are no local patches.

The ssl/bodge directory contains files taken from the NSS repo that we required
for building libssl outside of its usual build environment.
