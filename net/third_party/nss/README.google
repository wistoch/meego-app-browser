  :pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:/cvsroot

  * Commenting out a couple of functions because they need NSS symbols
    which may not exist in the system NSS library.
    patches/versionskew.patch

The ssl/bodge directory contains files taken from the NSS repo that we required
for building libssl outside of its usual build environment.
