This contains a stripped down version of TR1::Boost version 1.36.0.  It
contains only the files required to use tr1::tuple in Visual Studio 2005.
All other files have been removed.  The original packing of Boost tuple used
to create this version was taken from the googlemock project download page:

  http://googlemock.googlecode.com/files/boost_tr1_tuple_1_36_0.zip

This code is released under the Boost Software License - Version 1.0.  See
boost_1_36_0/LICENSE_1_0.txt for details.

Steps to reproduce stripped down package:
  1) Download from
     http://googlemock.googlecode.com/files/boost_tr1_tuple_1_36_0.zip
  2) Unzip the package.  This will create the boost_1_36_0 directory.
  3) Create a .cpp file with one line:
       #include <tuple>
  4) Run this file through the Visual C++ preprocessor, making sure that the
     same compiler options (/I, /D, etc) are the same as for the the rest
     project, and that #{BOOST_ROOT}/boost/tr1/tr1;${BOOST_ROOT} are added
     to the include path path.  To get the preprocess output in Visual Studio,
     select the .cpp file, go to Properties | C/C++ | Preprocessor, and set
     "Generate Preprocessed File" to Yes.
 *5) In the preprocessed file, find all header files referenced in the
     boost_1_36_0 subdirectory.
  6) For each file in the boost_1_36_0 directory, if it is not referenced in
     the list produced in step 5, delete it.

The result should be 389 files, at about 2.4 megs. Adding in the
LICENSE_1_0.txt file brings the distribution to an even 390 files.

In comparison the full expansion of boost_tr1_tuple_1_36_0.zip is 1097 files
using 9.2 megs.

* For step 5, the following bash line helps generate a list of files:

    cat file.i | grep "^#line" | grep boost_1_36_0 | \
        tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f3 | tr -d \" | sort -u
