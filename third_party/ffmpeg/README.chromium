This contains FFmpeg's public header files from the output of a "make install"
command.  The header files are from FFmpeg revision 18286.

Steps to reproduce:
  1) If on Windows, refer to http://ffmpeg.arrozcru.org for environment setup
  2) Check out FFmpeg from their repository
  3) ./configure --prefix=/path/to/chrome/src/third_party/ffmpeg
  4) make && make install
  5) Remove bin and lib folders, leaving the include folder behind

The project contains some hand-written DEF files used to generate import
libraries to permit dynamically loading FFmpeg.  The libaries are linked in
using /DELAYLOAD to avoid having the DLLs present at run-time.

We don't use the import libraries generated from building FFmpeg because they
export every method by ordinal, which makes binary compatability with different
builds of FFmpeg difficult if not impossible.  Furthermore, it is much easier
to update a DEF file instead of rebuilding FFmpeg to generate new import
libraries.
