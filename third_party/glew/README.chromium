License File: LICENSE.txt

This is Chrome's local copy of the GLEW library, which is currently
used to interface to OpenGL and extensions to implement the WebGL
specification.

Compared to the original distribution:

  - GLEW was changed to dynamically look up the OpenGL 1.1 entry
    points in addition to those for later OpenGL versions and
    extensions. This was necessary to be able to stop linking directly
    against libGL.so on Linux due to http://crbug.com/16800 .

  - The implementation of NSGLGetProcAddress has been changed to use
    the standard dlfcn.h functions rather than the deprecated
    mach-o/dyld.h ones.

  - A GLEW_NO_GLU #define was added to prevent including GL/glu.h.

  - A glxewContextInitWithDisplay(Display*) was added and exposed in
    glxew.h in order to allow the GLX 1.3 entry points to be used to
    create the first drawable.

  - Fixed the order of #include guards around
    _glewInit_GLX_VERSION_1_1 in glew.c when GLEW_MX is defined.

  - For the case where GLEW_MX is not defined, added a wglewInit() and
    support for dynamically looking up even the core WGL entry points.
