This is Chrome's local copy of the GLEW library, which is currently
used to interface to OpenGL and extensions to implement the WebGL
specification.

Compared to the original distribution, the implementation of
NSGLGetProcAddress has been changed to use the standard dlfcn.h
functions rather than the deprecated mach-o/dyld.h ones.

Originally obtained from http://glew.sourceforge.net/ . The
LICENSE.txt from that distribution has been preserved here.
