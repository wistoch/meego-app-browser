This directory contains tools from the "GNU utilities for Win32" project
(http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/), which provides "ports of common GNU
utilities to native Win32".

On 2005/10/28 I downloaded and unpacked the UnxUtils.zip file from the site,
then unzipped UnxUpdates.zip into the usr/local/wbin directory.  I then
checked-in the contents of the wbin directory (and nothing else).

I verified these tools use only DLLs available on any modern Windows machine.
In addition to Windows DLLs, the tools use msvcrt.dll and msvcrt40.dll, but
NOT msvcr7*.dll.
