Description:
  Libjingle provides xmpp support to the sync code, which
  lives at chrome/browser/sync/notifier.

  Libjingle is distributed under a Berkeley-style license detailed in
  files/COPYING.

Local Modifications:
  Applied changes per the patchfile mods-since-v0_4_0.diff.  That
  includes the following items.
  * Added support to specify the token_service in the auth stanza.
  * Added support for non-gaia ids associated with gaia accounts.
  * A bug fix in the task code to prevent infinite looping of aborted
    tasks.
  * Removed the definition of DISALLOW_EVIL_CONSTRUCTORS from common.h
  * Introduction of #undef ETIMEDOUT to get around a conflict versus
    pthreads.h.
  * We use an "overrides" directory for some headers, for example,
    scoped_ptr.h and basic_types.h, to avoid a duplicate functionality.
    The overrides typically pull an implementation from src/base, and
    then supplement this with any additional defines not found
    in Chromium.
  * Edits to config.h, changing some #defines.
  * Removed some scripts and build files not needed by Chromium: aclocal.m4,
    config.guess, config.h.in, config.sub, configure, depcomp, install-sh,
    ltmain.sh, missing.
  * Removed Makefile.in files, *.sln, *.vcproj.
  * Removed "examples", "thirdparty", and "sessions" directories.
  * Removed a number of unneeded scope specifications to appease gcc.
  * Renamed "talk/xmpp/constants.*" to "talk/xmpp/xmppconstants.*" to get
    around an IncrediBuild link error.  Apparently IncrediBuild can become
    confused when two compilation units have the same filename.
  * Added a #define guard to libjingle's base/logging.h to prevent the
    LOG() macros from being redefined when included by users of the
    library.  The #define guard is SAFE_TO_DEFINE_TALK_BASE_LOGGING_MACROS.
