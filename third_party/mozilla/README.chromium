Name: Cocoa extension code from Camino
URL: http://caminobrowser.org/

Description:
  This directory contains the following files come from (Mozilla) Camino
  (src/camino/src/extensions):

    NSPasteboard+Utils.h/mm
    NSScreen+Utils.h/m
    NSString+Utils.h/m
    NSURL+Utils.h/m
    NSWorkspace+Utils.h/m

Local modifications:
  NSURL+Utils.m was modified to use non-deprecated Cocoa APIs to allow
  compilation on future versions of Mac OS X.
  NSString+Utils.m was renamed to NSString+Utils.mm and modified to use GURL
  for validation in -[NSString isValidURI].
