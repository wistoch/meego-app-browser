Local files (not taken from upstream):
README.chromium
config.h
descriptor2_pb.py

A protobuf.gyp file has been added for building with Chromium.

There are no local changes to the code itself .. yet. We have a local copy of
this code because we intend to add support for retaining unknown fields to
protobuf-lite.
