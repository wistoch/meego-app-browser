This is a copy of SCons, a Python-based software build tool (that is,
replacement for Make) that we use for cross-platform builds.

Current version:  1.0.1.d20080915

Originally obtained from:

    http://www.scons.org/downloads.php

SCons ships under an MIT license.  See the scons-LICENSE file in
this directory for specifics.

We check in the contents of the scons-local-* package(s) provided
by the SCons Project.

Before checking in, we copy the contents of the version-specific
"scons-local-{VERSION}" to the "scons-local".  We do this so we can use
Subversion to diff and revert versions more easily, and to make it easier
to propagate any local modifications we might make to any new versions
we check in.

We currently do not have any local modifications to the SCons code itself.

To import a new version of SCons:

- Visit http://www.scons.org/downloads.php

- Download the latest scons-local package.

- Unpack in the current directory:

    $ tar zxf scons-local-{VERSION}.tar.gz

- Copy the contents of the version-specific directory to scons-local:

    $ cp -rf scons-local-{VERSION}/* scons-local

- Update this README.google file to reflect the new version number.

- Check in.
