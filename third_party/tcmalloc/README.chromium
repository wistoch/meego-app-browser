        The chromium patched sources, copied from the vendor/
        subdirectory and containing our local modifications.

        We only copy over the vendor/src/ subdirectory (the only piece
        we need) but still leave it in a chromium/src/ subdirectory to
        keep the directory structures in parallel.
