Local Modifications:

- patches/close_notify.patch: tlslite/TLSRecordLayer.py was changed to force
  the socket to be closed when the SSL connection is closed. This is is
  necessary at this point since WinHTTP does not seem to react to the SSL
  close notify. It's also needed to prevent a hang on Linux.  See also 
  http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=41C9B18B.2010201%40ag.com&forum_name=tlslite-users
- patches/python26.patch: Replace sha, md5 module imports with hashlib, as
  they are deprecated in Python 2.6
