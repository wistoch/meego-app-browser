# Chromium crontab input file for restarting build slaves on reboot.
# Feed this to crontab as follows:
#
#    $ crontab -u $USER crontab.in
#
# Note that it's a good idea to specify the -u option when using
# a role account, because crontab can get confused by su.
#
# Crontab will run the command with a hermetic environment with
# $SHELL, $LOGNAME (also $USER if necessary) and $HOME set from
# /etc/passwd, and $PATH set to "/usr/bin:/bin", so there's no
# need to set environment variables.
#
# $MAILTO is used explicitly by cron for failure notification.
