These are terrible, terrible hacks.

They are meant to be temporary. clang currently doesn't allow running a plugin
AND doing the normal codegen process. We want our syntax complaining plugins to
run during normal compile, but for now, you can user run_plugin.sh to hack the
build system to do a syntax check.
