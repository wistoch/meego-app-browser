# There are two kinds of suppressions in this file.
# 1. third party stuff we have no control over
#
# 2. Suppressions for real chromium bugs that are not yet fixed.
# These should all be in chromium's bug tracking system (but a few aren't yet).
# Periodically we should sweep this file and the bug tracker clean by
# running overnight and removing outdated bugs/suppressions.
