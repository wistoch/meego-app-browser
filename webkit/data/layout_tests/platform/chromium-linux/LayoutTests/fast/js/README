eval-keyword-vs-function
eval-cross-window
--------------------------
Only difference is the value of toString() on the window object.

constructor-attributes
--------------------------
The only difference is that V8 defines the constructor attribute on the
prototype for DOM objects just as for other objects.
The V8 implementation is consistent with the JavaScript specification and IE.
