This directory is intentionally empty since all vista test expectations are in chromium-win.  However, if the directory is actually empty then folks using git to track the Chromium repo will not get a directory at all which makes run_webkit_tests.py a sad panda.  Thus this README is here to make sure the directory is added so tests can run.

This file should be removed whenever vista-specific test expectations are checked into this directory.
