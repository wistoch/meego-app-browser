This directory contains Inspector front-end files that are currently forked from
the implementation upstream.

Our intent is to upstream or unfork these as soon as possible. For all intents
and purposes, we consider the presence of this directory a ghastly hack that we
all regret but have to live with to move forward.

Please do not add more files to this directory as this will aggravate the pain
and suffering already inflicted by this forked state. If you need to make
changes to this directory, please consider spending your energy on upstreaming
or unforking them instead.
