// - When the first frame load is committed during a navigation, m_previousItem
// will be the HistoryItem corresponding to the page we have just left.
// [m_previousItem refers to the item passed to addItem() or goToItem() 2 calls
// ago.] Also, WebCore will have already updated it with saved document state.

// It seems some are not used except in Mac-specific code, so we can get away
// without them.  They've been completely removed from our version so that we
// can immediately tell from compile failures if WebCore starts using them.
