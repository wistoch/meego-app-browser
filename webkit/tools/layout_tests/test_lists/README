The files in this directory are read by the run_webkit_tests.py script
and used to determine which tests to run and which failures to
consider regressions.

If we *never* expect to pass a test (e.g. a test for Apple's Objective-C API),
then add it to tests_ignore.txt. If we might ever want to pass the test, first
file a bug, then add it to tests_fixable.txt.

Tests can have any combination of the following metadata associated with
them (optional):
  SKIP : We don't want to run the test (perhaps because it hangs).
  DEBUG  : Expectations apply only to the Debug build.
  RELEASE : Expectations apply only to the Release build.
  LINUX/WIN/MAC: Expectations apply only to the listed platform(s).

Tests can also have one or more expectations (required):
  PASS
  FAIL
  TIMEOUT
  CRASH

The format of a test line is as follows:
METADATA : relative/path/to/test.html = EXPECTATIONS

For example,
LINUX : LayoutTests/media = PASS FAIL

The above means that all the media tests are flaky, but only on Linux.

Note that tests_fixable.txt and tests_ignored.txt aren't allowed to share any
lines. Except for skipped tests, all tests are run. In calculating success
metrics, we ignore tests in tests_ignored.txt and deferred tests.
