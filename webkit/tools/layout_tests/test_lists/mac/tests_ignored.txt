// XHTML tests.  See bug 793944.  These tests seem like they work, but
// only because the expected output expects to see JS errors.  There is
// no point in running these tests, because they are giving us a false
// sense of testing that isn't really happening.  Furthermore, since they
// appear to pass if we do try to run them, we can't even list them as
// permanently expected to fail.
