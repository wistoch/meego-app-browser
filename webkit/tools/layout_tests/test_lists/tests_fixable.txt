// This is an interesting one.
// The test has an error which causes it to output a message to the console.
// Apple's expected results include this error. Actually, Apple's expected
// results include the error twice, because (apparently unique among console
// debugging messages) it's generated during rendering. The problem is that
// we end up invoking the renderer twice when we're doing pixel tests, once 
// otherwise, so we get different results depending on whether pixel tests are
// enabled. (Neither matches Apple's exactly... when we have pixel tests on,
// the duplicate error message ends up at the end of the file, while Apple's
// results have them both at the top.) But this test doesn't represent a real
// failure in any way and nothing needs to be done to fix it. I'm leaving it
// in tests_fixable in case we change the test shell's webview delegate to
// ignore console messages while doing a pixel dump
